### Troubleshooting

* **No audio in some videos?**

  * Update VLC or use another modern player‚Äîsome codecs (e.g., Opus) have playback issues in older versions.

* **FFmpeg errors or audio extraction fails?**

  * Double-check that `ffmpeg -version` works.

* **HTTP Error 403 or fragment not found?**

  * YouTube sometimes blocks high-res streams. The script automatically falls back to the next-best quality.
