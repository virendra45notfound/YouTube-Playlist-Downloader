# YouTube & Playlist Downloader (CLI Version)

A simple command-line Python script for downloading YouTube single videos, playlists, or MP3 audio files using **yt-dlp** and **FFmpeg**.

## Features

* Download a single video (up to 1080p) with audio merged into MP4 format.
* Download an entire playlist of videos.
* Extract MP3 audio from a single video or an entire playlist.
* Customizable output directory structure.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.6 or higher
* [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (must be installed and in your system PATH)

### Install Python Package Dependencies

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
